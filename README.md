# update_covid19_twitter_thread
A while ago I saw a bad tweet comparing COVID-19 to the flu. Because I am a petty man, I have been keeping [a running thread](https://twitter.com/gottapatchemall/status/1246956300904226816) documenting the growth of COVID-19 statistics since then. I have decided to automate this because it is extremely depressing to do it manually.
